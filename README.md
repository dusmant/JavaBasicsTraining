# JavaBasicsTraining
This project is to provide the fundamentals of the java language along with examples, so that students can learn it easily... If you want to contribute to this, feel free to do so !!!

This training is only about the JAVA language basics and the concepts related to them along with pertinent examples.
This does not cover all the technology stack built on top of Java (e.g. EJB or something like that...) 
Just basic fundamentals.

It can be covered in 14 days ( everyday spending just 2 to 3 hours of time, along with coding )
